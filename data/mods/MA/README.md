# Notes

Overmap terrain might be unpolished at times on some of the overmaps (e.g. fields w/o much swamps or forests), so you can use new external options to spice up pregenerated overmap with procgen features:

* OVERMAP_PLACE_SWAMPS - Allows to place procgen swamps during overmap generation.
* OVERMAP_PLACE_RAVINES - Allows to place procgen ravines during overmap generation.
* OVERMAP_PLACE_CITIES - Allows to place cities during overmap generation.
* OVERMAP_PLACE_RAILROAD_STATIONS - Allows to place railroad stations during overmap generation.
* OVERMAP_PLACE_FOREST_TRAILS - Allows to place procgen forest trails during overmap generation.
